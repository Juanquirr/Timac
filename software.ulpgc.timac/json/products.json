        "A screwdriver is an essential hand tool designed for driving screws into materials or removing them with precision and control, featuring a slender, ergonomic handle—typically made from durable materials like wood, plastic, or rubberized composites for a comfortable grip that reduces hand fatigue during prolonged use—and a hardened steel shaft, varying in length between 3 and 12 inches to suit tasks from intricate electronics repair to heavy furniture assembly, tipped with a versatile flathead ideal for slotted screws, making the Fei Dai a reliable choice for both professional tradespeople and home DIY enthusiasts."
