# Timac Hardware Store

## Description
TIMAC is a web project designed to renew the image and functionality of hardware store websites, offering a modern, intuitive and user-friendly interface. Many hardware stores still have websites with outdated designs and inefficient navigation, which hinders the user experience when searching for products, comparing prices or shopping online.

TIMAC not only modernises the look and feel of an online hardware store, but also integrates functionalities that improve user interaction, such as advanced filters, smart search and a simplified checkout process.

With this project, we aim not only to improve the digital presence of hardware stores, but also to boost their sales and build customer loyalty through an efficient and user-friendly platform.

1. Navigate between different product categories and subcategories
2. Search by item name
3. Filter by price, brand, size...
4. Create a user account
5. Log in to your account
6. Add a product to cart
